  "description" : "The Inforce 6640 SBC is based on Qualcomm®’s first custom 64-bit quad-core processor, Snapdragon™ 820 (APQ8096 SoC) which is manufactured in an advanced 14nm FinFET Low Power Plus (LLP) fabrication process that allows faster switching speeds and lower voltage operation in a smaller footprint. With better imaging capabilities due to the Spectra™ camera ISP, an improved GPU architecture and excellent video and connectivity options, it is targeted at embedded system applications that require hi-tech smart visual technologies and intense video Analytics. It supports H.265 (HEVC) playback @4K60 and capture @4K30.",
